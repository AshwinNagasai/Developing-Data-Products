## Background  

This presentation is created using R markdown in RStudio as a pitch for the Shiny app that can be found at  
https://ashwinnagasai.shinyapps.io/Developing_Data_Products_Final_Project/   

The app uses linear regression to predict Fertility using  Agriculture and Education as the predictors  

The Shiny App Source code is available at https://github.com/AshwinNagasai/Developing-Data-Products

## Data  

Swiss Fertility data with standardized fertility measure and socioeconomic indicators for each of 47 French-speaking provinces of Switzerland at 1888. The data frame has 47 observations with 6 variables, the variables considered are   

- Fertility (Ig) - common standardized fertility measure  
- Agriculture - % of males involved in agriculture as occupation  
- Education - % education beyond primary school for draftees
